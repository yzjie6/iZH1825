Marine microorganisms produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites, which represent a significant source for the discovery of novel antibiotics. Heterologous expression is a valuable tool to discover novel marine microbial secondary metabolites and increase their productivity while reducing the interference of impurities in isolating target compounds. However, marine-derived synthetic biology chassis cell is still very scarce. In this study, we build an efficient plug-and-play Marine-derived Gene Clusters Expression Platform 1.0 (MGCEP 1.0) by the systematic engineering of one deep-sea-derived Streptomyces atratus SCSIO ZH16. For a proof of concept, several microbial bioactive metabolites, including marinacarbolines (Î²-carboline alkaloid), A201A (aminonucleoside), desotamides (nonribiosomal peptides), pendolmycins (nonribiosomal peptides), pre-himastatin (nonribiosomal peptides), and vineomycinone B2 (type II polyketides) were efficiently expressed in this platform. Moreover, two new angucycline antibiotics Grincamycin U and V were also expressed in MGCEP 1.0. Dynamic patterns of global biosynthetic gene expression in this chassis cell were revealed upon the introduction of heterologous nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene clusters at the transcriptome level. The platform MGCEP 1.0 provides new possibilities for expressing cryptic microbial secondary metabolites, increasing the production of target compounds, especially of marine origin.
